# Multilabel Image Classification CNN
## About:
In a group with two others, we aim to investigate the performance of several convolutional neural networks on a semi-supervised multilabel image classification problem; we use the Combo MNIST dataset which consists of noisy images containing two alphanumeric characters each. We experimented with various architectures, including our own CNN design, VGGNet, AlexNet, and ResNet, observing that the ResNet50 model outperformed the other models, including its deeper counterparts, ResNet101 and ResNet152. We also experimented with different pre-processing techniques through random augmentation of a subset of images in the training set, and used hyperparameter tuning and different bagging techniques to boost the accuracy of our model. In the end, we were able to achieve a maximum accuracy score of 94.66% on the unseen dataset.
